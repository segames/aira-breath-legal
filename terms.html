    <h1>Aira Breathe Terms of Use</h1>
    
    <div class="meta">
        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 8 January 2026</p>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 8 January 2026</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Aira Breathe mobile application (the "App"). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>
    
    <p><strong>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>1) About Aira Breathe</h2>
    <p>Aira Breathe is a wellbeing app designed to guide breathing sessions and related relaxation practices. The App is intended for general wellness and informational purposes only.</p>
    
    <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You may use the App only if you can form a binding contract with us under applicable law. If you are using the App on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>
    
    <h2>3) Wellbeing Use Only – Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>Aira Breathe does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The App is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare professional with questions about a medical condition.</li>
        <li>Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you read or experience in the App.</li>
        <li>Do not use the App for medical emergencies. If you think you may have an emergency, call your local emergency number immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4) Safety Guidance</h2>
    <p>Breathing exercises may not be appropriate for everyone.</p>
    <p>You agree to use the App responsibly and to stop any session if you feel unwell. Stop immediately if you experience dizziness, faintness, shortness of breath, pain, or discomfort.</p>
    <p>If you have any health concerns, are pregnant, or are managing a condition (including respiratory or cardiovascular conditions), consult a qualified professional before using breathing practices or changing your routine.</p>
    
    <h2>5) Your Content & On-Device Data</h2>
    
    <h3>5.1 On-device storage</h3>
    <p>Your session history and preferences are stored on your device (for example, appearance, sound, haptics, reminders, and session history).</p>
    
    <h3>5.2 Managing and deleting your data</h3>
    <p>You can clear local session history and related data from within the App's Settings (where available). Uninstalling the App generally removes App data from that device, subject to iOS behavior (such as backups and restoration).</p>
    
    <h3>5.3 Feedback and communications</h3>
    <p>If you choose to contact us (for example, by email), you are responsible for the information you provide. Please avoid sharing sensitive health information unless necessary.</p>
    
    <h2>6) Optional Apple Integrations (Apple Music / Apple Health / HealthKit)</h2>
    <p>Some features are optional and may require permissions you grant to Apple system services (such as Apple Music playback or Apple Health/HealthKit access).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Permissions can be managed or revoked at any time in iOS Settings (and, for Health, in the Health app permissions pages).</li>
        <li>Your use of Apple services is also subject to Apple's terms, policies, and device settings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>7) License and Acceptable Use</h2>
    
    <h3>7.1 License</h3>
    <p>We grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your own non-commercial use, subject to these Terms.</p>
    
    <h3>7.2 Restrictions</h3>
    <p>Except where permitted by law, you agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, lend, or sublicense the App</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code from the App</li>
        <li>Circumvent security or access controls</li>
        <li>Misuse the App, including using it in a way that could harm others or interfere with the App's operation</li>
        <li>Use the App in violation of applicable laws or regulations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>8) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its design, text, graphics, audio, visual elements, software, and associated content, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.</p>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms transfers ownership of any intellectual property rights to you.</p>
    
    <h2>9) Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
    <p>The App may interact with third-party services (for example, Apple Music or Apple Health/HealthKit). We do not control third-party services and are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Your use of third-party services is governed by their own terms and policies.</p>
    
    <h2>10) Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.</p>
    <p>We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.</p>
    
    <h2>11) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the App.</li>
        <li>Where liability cannot be excluded, our liability will be limited to the minimum amount permitted by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited under applicable law (for example, certain liabilities relating to fraud or willful misconduct, or consumer rights that cannot be waived).</p>
    
    <h2>12) Indemnity (Where Permitted)</h2>
    <p>To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your misuse of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>
    
    <h2>13) Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top reflects the most recent version. By continuing to use the App after changes take effect, you agree to the updated Terms.</p>
    <p>If changes are material, we may provide additional notice in the App.</p>
    
    <h2>14) Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the App if you violate these Terms or if required for legal, security, or operational reasons. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.</p>
    <p>Sections that by their nature should survive termination (such as warranties, liability limitations, and intellectual property) will survive.</p>
    
    <h2>15) Governing Law and Jurisdiction (England and Wales)</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales.</p>
    <p>If you are a consumer habitually resident outside England and Wales, you may also benefit from mandatory consumer protections under the laws of your country of residence.</p>
    <p>The courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App (meaning you may also be able to bring a claim in your local courts where mandatory laws allow).</p>
